# Gender-and-Age-Detection-System
Gender &amp; Age Detection System created using CNN Algorithm. 

### This Project is my 1st project as a Data Science Intern at CodeClause.

* Using the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithm, I developed a robust system that can accurately predict the gender and age of a person based on their images. 📸💡

* During this project, I dove deep into the world of image datasets, leveraging CNN's powerful capabilities.

* Additionally, I performed extensive exploratory data analysis to gain valuable insights and optimize the prediction model. 📊🔍
